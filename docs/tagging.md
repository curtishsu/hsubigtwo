Curently, each game can be tagged with one name. it is done via the settings. 

The UX for the tag:
1. Tag this game should read 'Tag Game'. It should be sub-header font
2. Underneath is a text box where a user can input a tag
3. Under the box is a list of suggestions as buttons for the tags. The tag list should be: the tag for the most recent game (chronological order). If no tag was assigned, use the tag for the most recent game that does have a tag. As the user types letters for a tag, the list of suggestions below should fill with past tags that match the spelling of what is typed into the box up to four suggestions. If a user clicks one of the suggestions, then that is the tag that is automatically filled in
4. If the user presses enter while typing, then a new tag is created and that is attributed to the game. Tag text is capped at 24 characters.
5. There is an x on the name of the tag once it is applied to a game. If a user clicks on it, then it is removed and the tagging input reopens with suggestions prefilled.
6. Each game can only have one tag
7. The 'Save Tag' button should be deleted. There is no button needed to save a tag. once a tag is committed to a game, either by the user clicking enter when free typing or clicking on a suggestion, that tag is attached to the game and saved.



### Additional entry points. 
If a game does not have a tag, by clicking on it on the history page, an interstitial opens up where you can assign it a tag. The tagging and tag suggestion should is the same as above. There is a box where the user can put in the name of the tag, and there is a list of suggestions below.
