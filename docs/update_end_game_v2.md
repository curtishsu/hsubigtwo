Currently, the end game pulls from the avatars directory to query photos to be used for the end game screen. I've updated the director now such that there is a folder for each player (albert, yiming, curtis, and darwin). The photo for the end game screen should be pulled from the director. 
If the player gets first place, then that players photo should be pulleed from the subdirectory `1st`. Otherwise, the photo is pulled from the overall director. For example, if Albert wins, then the photo for Albert is pulled from the albert/1st directory and all players are pulled from their respective directories without going into the `1st` directory. The photo should be pulled randomly from the directory.
