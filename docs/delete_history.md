Part of the issue with testing is that a lot fake games are created for testing purposes. I want to be able to delete a game from the history ledger.

User flow
1. From the ledger, the user can swipe leftwards. On a laptop, this means swiping with two fingers on the mouse, on mobile this means swiping with finger while pressed When this happens, there is a small red tab that slides out that is red with a trash can. When it is clicked, the row is deleted.
2. If a row is deleted, it should be deleted from the database. Note that the last game mechanic should no longer pull that game if it is the last game pulled
3. There should be a small text interstitial pop up saying 'Game Deleted' and have an undo button next to it. This should disappear after two seconds. If the user clicks undo, then the game isn't deleted.
